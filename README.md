    <h3>FUZZY LOGIC CONTROLLER IMPLEMENTATION TO AN ARDUINO-BASED</h3>
</div>

## :dart: Application purpose
* To solve a problem of my graduation
* To learn about fuzzy logic on embedded systems

## :checkered_flag: About challenge
* The challenge was monitoring a water level of a tank and a temperature of a engine.
* According the data level water and temperature of engine, we use fuzzy logical to know about the power engine and control it with a hardware.
* The information was showed in a little system based on nodejs providing static files and reading a serial port of hardware like image bellow.
